 * An AbstractBehaviour allows you to attach reusable behaviours to GameObjects (steering, rotating, billboarding, etc).
 * A behaviour is set on a GameObject, which in turn passes in a reference to itself through the setOwner method.
 * This way we can enforce that a Behaviour can never have an owner different from the object it has been attached to.
 *
 * The concept is similar to MonoBehaviours in Unity.
